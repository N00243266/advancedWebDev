This app is my online art gallery built with Laravel and Tailwind CSS where users can perform full CRUD operations
— create, read, update, and delete artworks. 
Each piece displays details like title, artist, year, price, comments along with an image. Users can also like and zoom in artworks, 
view their favorites and see a color palette generated from each image, giving a complete overview of the artwork.

I used Laravel migrations to set up the database, including a liked column to track favorites. Users can like artworks and view their favorites. This allows users to view a dedicated list of the artworks, creating a personalized gallery experience.

Additionally, I integrated the Color Extractor package, which automatically analyzes each artwork’s image to generate a color palette. 
These palettes are displayed below the artworks, adding a visually engaging layer and helping users quickly understand the artwork’s dominant colors.


Overall, the app combines functionality, responsive frontend design and interactive visual features, making it a practical tool for 
managing artworks and an enjoyable experience for users exploring my gallery.
