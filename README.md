This app is my online art gallery built with Laravel and Tailwind CSS where users can create, read, update, and delete artworks. 
Each piece displays details like title, artist, year, price, comments along with an image. Users can also like artworks, 
view their favorites and see a color palette generated from each image.

I used Laravel migrations to set up the database, including a liked column to track favorites. Users can like artworks and view their favorites.

I also integrated the Color Extractor package to automatically generate a color palette from each artworkâ€™s image, making the gallery more 
interactive and visually engaging.
